First Journey Into The Unseen is a small interactive narrative game made in Twine that serves as a prequel to the Roblox game Unseen, which involves
the player having to conquer 3 different trials to reach the end of the narrative (The Unseen game was made in a team of 3 and work on both games was done from June-July 2023, where I mainly worked on the design of the 3 game levels and overall UI of the game)
